# -Password-Strength-Checker

This is a simple Password Strength Checker built using Python. The tool evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria and provides instant feedback to the user.

It helps users create stronger passwords by checking for:

Length

Presence of uppercase letters

Presence of lowercase letters

Presence of digits

Presence of special characters

Technologies Used
Python 3

Regular Expressions (re module)

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook (Optional)

How It Works üöÄ
The script checks the entered password and scores it based on:

Length (Minimum 8 characters)

Uppercase Letters (A-Z)

Lowercase Letters (a-z)

Numbers (0-9)

Special Characters (e.g., @, #, $)

Each satisfied condition increases the score. The password is then classified as:

‚ùå Weak Password

‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate Password

‚úÖ Strong Password
